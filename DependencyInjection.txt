Dependency Injection in the MarketingFirm Class

Instead of containing a specific type of SweepstakesManager, MarketingFirm has an ISweepstakesManager interface 
member variable.  This allows MarketingFirm to determine which SweepstakesManager (that implements the ISweepstakesManager 
interface) to use at run time.  MarketingFirm is not dependent on a particular SweepstakesManager.  The MarketingFirm 
constructor injects the SweepstakesManager into the class at run time.
