Dependency Injection in the MarketingFirm Class

Instead of containing a specific type of SweepstakesManager, MarketingFirm has an ISweepstakesManager interface 
member variable.  This allows it to determine which SweepstakesManager to use at run time.  It is not dependent
on a particular one.  The MarketingFirm constructor injects the proper SweepstakesManager into the class.
